# SentinelIP
***Status: In development***

**SentinelIP** is a real-time IP threat detection service that combines proxy & VPN detection with IP threat intelligence to protect against malicious traffic. It helps identify suspicious IPs, mitigate fraud, and block bot attacks for web applications and APIs.

## Features

- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Detect and flag malicious IP addresses in real-time.
- **Proxy & VPN Detection**: Identify users accessing through proxies or VPNs.
- **IP Threat Intelligence**: Use known threat intelligence to block malicious traffic.
- **API Integration**: Easily integrate with your web applications or APIs for automatic threat detection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18+ installed
- Access to the internet for real-time threat data and IP checks.

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/j4gwire/SentinelIP.git
cd SentinelIP
```

### Running Locally

1.  Install dependencies:  ```go mod tidy```
2. Start the application: ```go run cmd/main.go```
3. The application will run locally on `http://localhost:8080/`. You can test the threat detection functionality at: http://localhost:8080/threat-detection
